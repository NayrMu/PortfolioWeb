					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
					Born and raised in Independence, Missouri, I embarked on my journey into the world of software development. 
					I started college for Computer Science at Missouri State University in 2019. However, after struggling with my schooling during the 
					quarentine in 2020, I decided to step way from academia in 2021.
					For two enriching years, I delved into full-time work, learning more about the world and myself. Now,
					I'm back in academia at Western Governor's University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, set to graduate in June 2025.	
					</p>
					<p>
					My fascination, for software crosses multiple disciplines, from crafting elegant websites to breathing life into applications and delving into the intricate 
					world of embedded systems! Some of my favorite projects include a C# CLI tool, 
					a rocket fuel calculation Python program, and the website you're exploring now. This is just 
					the start of my journey, with a universe of ideas yet to explore. Join me as I continue pushing the boundaries of software, one line of code at a time.
